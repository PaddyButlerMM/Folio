        <p1 id="bio"><span style="font-family: Oswald">In 2015 Paddy Butler helped set up Libreria Bookshop as part of startup incubator Second Home.
            <br> He served as creative director of Libreria for five years building the brand identity through<br> 
            a rich, diversity-led culutural programme and distinctive books curation. Designed by internationally<br>
            renowned Spanish architects SelgasCano, the space was created so as to reimagine what a booskshop could<br>
            be. With broad themes such as Brain & Being, Bad Feminist, Africana, Time & Space, Libreria playfully <br>
            disregards conventional bookshop layout to enhance serendipitous discovery.</span></p></br>
         
        <p2  id="bio2"><span style="font-family: Oswald">
            The cultural programme welcomed important guest speakers such as Marcus du Sautoy, Dr Sophie Scott, <br> 
            Gary Younge, Michael Chabon, Reni Eddo-Lodge and Franklin Foer. As lead editor and presenter of the <br> 
            Libreria Podcast, this approach was expanded to the airwaves â€“ inviting novelists Bret Easton Ellis, Ottessa <br>
            Moshfegh & Bernardine Evaristo (having launched Girl, Women, Other at Libreria, Bernardine would go on to <br>
            win the world prestigious 2018 Booker Prize), physicist Carlo Rovelli along with artists such as <br>
            Conrad Shawcross and James Bridle others.</span></p2>
