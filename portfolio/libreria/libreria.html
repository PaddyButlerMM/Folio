        <p1 id="bio"><span style="font-family: Oswald">
            In 2015 Paddy Butler helped set up Libreria Bookshop as part of startup incubator Second Home. He served<br>
            as creative director of Libreria for five years building the brand identity through a rich, diversity-<br>
            led culutural programme. Designed by internationally renowned Spanish architects SelgasCano, the space<br>
            was created to reimagine what a booskshop could be. With broad themes such as Brain & Being, BadFeminist<br>
            Africana, Time & Space, Libreria playfully disregards conventional bookshop layout to enhance more<br>
            serendipitous discovery.</span></p></br>
         
        <p2  id="bio2"><span style="font-family: Oswald">
            The cultural programme welcomed a variety of guest speakers to Libreria including Marcus du Sautoy, Dr<br> 
            Sophie Scott, Gary Younge, Michael Chabon, Reni Eddo-Lodge and Franklin Foer. While The Libreria Podcast<br>
            further relfected this approach welcoming novelists Bret Easton Ellis, Ottessa Moshfegh and Bernardine<br> 
            Evaristo (having launched Girl, Woman, Other at Libreria, Bernardine subsequently went on to win the 2018 Booker Prize).<br>
            And as well as interviewing scientists such as Carlo Rovelli, Paddy also spoke with conceptual artists<br>
            such as Conrad Shawcross and James Bridle.</span></p2>
