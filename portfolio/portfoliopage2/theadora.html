        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Two extraordinary lives from antiquity stand out for what they can teach us 
            about the complex political systems they experienced and lived through. Moreover, they can provide us with 
            invaluable insight into our own assumptions regarding our much vaunted but feverishly embattled democratic 
            systems. These exceptional individuals are respectively the courtesan Neaera and the actress – and then 
            empress – Theodora. One life documented through a private prosecution case in the courts of ancient Athens; 
            the other reflected back to us by court actors and officials of Justinian’s imperial Byzantium. Both were working 
            women who experienced close proximity to political and legal power in very different circumstances under 
            different regime structures. But what the comparison surprisingly shows is that women of the authoritarian
             Byzantium empire had greater legal protection than their counterparts in ancient democratic Greece. 
             What is less known is the fact that it wasn’t until the nineteenth century that British and American women were
              to be granted similar rights.</span> <br></br>

              <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">The prosecution of Neaera was brought by the Athenian statesman and orator Apollodorus in and around 343-340BC, 
              as documented in Demosthenes’ speeches under the title <i>Apollodorus: Against Neaera</i>. Neaera was a courtesan, or 
              more precisely a sex slave worker, owned by an elderly madam named Nicarete – who was herself a freedwoman and 
              an expert in spotting 'beautiful young women' and ‘bringing them up and training them in their craft.’ </span> <br></br>
    
              <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">The thrust of the prosecution was ostensibly based on the status of Neaera as an illegal alien (known as a <i>metic</i>),
                 but in reality it was politically motivated to destroy her partner: the statesman, Stephanus. Apollodorus and Stephanus had been on either side of a 
                 complex foreign policy battle regarding the enemy powers of Euboea and Olynthas. The hawkish Apollodorus would have preferred decisive military 
                 action, whereas Stephanus sided with a more cautious pragmatic approach. But in the dirty world of domestic politics it would seem that Stephanus 
                 deployed whatever means available – fair or foul – to take down and destroy his enemies. </span> <br></br>
            
                 <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">In the opening speech we are told that Stephanus had previously fabricated an elaborate case against Apollodorus – with the claim that the latter had
                  killed a woman with his bare hands in Aphidna, when in pursuit of a runaway slave. Stephanus is supposed to have ‘groomed some slaves’ as witnesses 
                  to be used in prosecuting the case against Apollodorus at the Palladium. Having sworn on oath that Apollodorus committed the murder, Stephanous, it 
                  eventually becomes clear, had been bribed by two powerful officials Cephisophon and Apollophanes to advance the downfall of Apollodorus. Apollodorus
                   therefore sought to settle the political score by prosecuting Neaera as a non-citizen living with Stephanus – given it was then illegal for an Athenian citizen 
                   to live in marriage to a non-citizen. At the time, the ultimate way to destroy a political opponent was through the law courts – hence the strategic prosecution 
                   of Neaera.</span> <br></br>
            
                   <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">This system was of course male dominated and even the 201 or 401 sitting court juries, in private and public cases, 
                    were also entirely made up of men. Domestically, most women were tied to household duties and sometimes even had to hide when guests were entertained. However, 
                    women of higher status would have exerted a certain moral influence, generally frowning on the practice of prostitution and to some extent reigning in certain male 
                    proclivities with a girdling of guilt. We know this from Apollodorus’s speech, where he schools the jury on their duty to their wives and daughters in condemning Neaera’s 
                    profession. Everything, it seems, was stacked against Neaera – and, indeed, against women in general. 
                    </span> <br></br>
                    
                    <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Although courtesans, or <i>hetaera</i>, had close relationships with powerful and influential men, it was unimaginable for 
                        women to effect any direct political influence. One such example is Neaera's friend, Metaneira, who enjoyed the passionate attentions of the influential statesman  
                        Lysias (famous for his speech on the <i>Thirty Tyrants</i>). And even if the extraordinary plays such as <i>Medea</i> and <i>Antigone</i> might suggest otherwise, caution is advised 
                        on perceived feminist sympathies. Written by men, for men, the alluringly strong female characters served as symbolic figures to instruct on moral matters regarding 
                        state and governance – they are not, then, proto-feminist plays. 
                </span> <br></br>
                <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">This, naturally, is not to deny the complexities at work. Aristophanes’ fascinating comic play <i>Assembly Women</i> does much 
                    to blur the edges in this regard. Praxagora, the leader of a band of 
                disaffected Athenian women who have seized power, institutes a ‘sharing’ communist society where sex is made free. As classicist Stephen Halliwell notes ‘It is no coincidence 
                that Praxagora had earlier announced the abolition of slave prostitutes, whose competition for clients is regulated only by their degree of beauty or ugliness.’ The satirical device
                 is here used to mock the inadequacies of the ruling elite, but it nevertheless inspires intriguing questions on gender dynamics and the downtrodden slave. When at the beginning 
                 of the play Praxagora enquires as to whether her followers have enacted what was asked of them in declaration of their commitment to the cause, they reply:
                </span> <br></br>

                <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
                Woman A  [Showing off].<i> I certainly have! I’ve let my armpits grow
                Far shaggier than a bush, as we agreed.</i>
            </span> <br></br>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
                Woman B . <i>Me too. I actually threw my razor out
                To guarantee I’d grow hirsute all over
                And loose all trace of femininity </i>
            </span> <br></br>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">The damning irony in Neaera’s case is that Apollodorous’ father, Pasion had also been a slave. A remarkable figure, he served 
                as a slave bank clerk who was granted manumission from his owners and rose to become a wealthy banker in his own right. Having donated huge sums of money to the city 
                Pasion was awarded with a very rare citizenship, which ensured his son the luxury of a privileged upbringing and elevated status. This is something we learn from a speech 
                by Demosthenes, in defence of Phormion – a separate case brought by Apollodorus against his stepbrother over inheritance from Pasion. If we are to believe Demosthenes’ 
                speech it holds that Apollodorus was perhaps not acting in a most dignified manner in prosecuting Phormion – Apollodorous had already agreed an inheritance split, but 
                had been recklessly profligate with it.
            </span> <br></br>
  <div class="image5">
        <img src="picnu.png" id="shpe5">
    </div>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Despite the understood pitfalls of retrospective moral lensing, Apollodorus's behaviour seems all-in-all to have been at best 
                pretty crass. However, in counterargument, you would doubtless conclude that the judgement of Apollodorus's integrity in relation to the enslaved Neaera here hardly matters, 
                given that his motives were political and directed at destroying his statesman rival, Stephanus. But the point is that it further demonstrates a political system which was 
                conditioned to sanction this line of prosecution and had little regard for the downtrodden in general – and in this instance an entirely blameless, female sex worker slave. 
                Would a conviction have destroyed her life? Most probably. It also reflects the cold utility which was very much embedded in the society’s moral values regarding 
                someone of her profession (all the more glaring when considering Pasion's relatively unhindered rise in the banking world, from slave to glorified citizen). This is something 
                which was not challenged, nor even addressed, until the Byzantine period and Empress Theodora’s reign – and still resonates, somewhat damningly, with our own times.
            </span> <br></br>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Neaera was therefore completely at the mercy of the schemes and whims of her powerful clients on the one hand – 
                and a legal-political system unwilling to recognise her or her 
            plight on the other. This included horrendous maltreatment at the hands of her erstwhile lover Phrynion.
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">A brutal individual, Phrynion often forced her to fornicate with him in public while on his reckless drunken sprees. 
            At a dinner party it is reported that he permitted the serving slaves to have sex with her while she was intoxicated. It should be made clear that we are not dealing 
            with a mindless individual who willingly ceded to such treatment – contractual circumstances of ‘property’ made it so. 
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
            This is not to say that Theodora’s world of 600CE would have been any more conciliatory, but it was a world in which her genius was remarkably given space to eventually 
            enact change in favour of the downtrodden. Importantly, her rise to power was not isolated: a lot of women ruled during this late Roman period, including the incredibly 
            powerful Empress Ariadne, and much later Empress Irene Asanina and Empress Anna Komnene. And Theodora’s niece, Sophia, would become the most powerful woman 
            ruler of the time. 
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">How did someone of Theodora’s social status rise to such stratospheric heights? And how, importantly, did she use that to exert 
            influence? The Byzantine world of sixth century CE was a markedly different place to the world of ancient Greece, and no less socially complex. This eastern part of the Roman empire 
            was stratified deep with many different sects and religions: all existing under the imperial umbrella of Constantine’s Christian monotheism. Born to a father who was master of the bears 
            at the circus hippodrome in Constantinople, Theodora would eventually go on to become Justinian’s lover, wife and then empress. 
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Justinian’s own story is one of rags to riches and, again, this wasn’t necessarily
             unique for the time. His family were of peasant farming stock and his uncle, who had left to join the army, had shot up through the ranks after a series of successful campaigns – 
             eventually seizing the throne becoming Emperor Justin. Having soon beckoned his young nephew to join him at court, Justinian quickly became a key adviser to his uncle, becoming 
             a very young emperor himself. But not without Theodora.
            </span> <br></br>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">In sixth-century Antioch, Severus, a prominent religious leader of the time, had set up a sanctuary for women who needed protection 
                and recovery from various traumatic experiences – more often due to careers as stage actresses and courtesans. It is thought that Theodora and Justinian met around this time. 
                Maybe Justinian saw something of himself in Theodora, and perhaps the power of her charm was all the more alluring given her social status – magnifying an already bewitching 
                intelligence. 
            </span> <br></br>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Justinian’s journey to Antioch would primarily have been made to see how things were going in the empire’s satellite power centres. 
                With their many dangerous religious factions exerting extraordinary spiritual influence on the populous, keeping a close eye on that potentially lethal powder keg was imperative. 
                These hippodrome hubs served at once for entertainment and at the same time circuitry nodal points for the systole and diastole movement of information throughout the empire. 
                Thus, with her father’s status and her close connection to Severus, Theodora would have had unique access to this world. Her father’s role, and education, critically meant that he 
                would have been able to teach her to read and write (not at all common skills to possess), and Theodora obviously demonstrated a precociously quick mind to be able to pick it up 
                with relative ease.
            </span> <br></br>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">When later working at the hippodrome, she took full advantage of this as her position required that she write confidential reports on 
                the different factions. Thus, historian David Potter tantalisingly puts it forward that these finely crafted missives may have caught Justinian's eye. This makes sense, Justinian was 
                somebody who would have been constantly on the look out for special talent, because the robust reliability of his network was going to be key in determining his rise to power.
            </span> <br></br>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Having consolidated her position at the court of Constantinople as Justinian’s wife and empress, the ever-engaging Potter then 
                provides us with a unique portrait of Theodora as she worked to mould her image by influencing complex policy. In his 2015 study <i>Theodora, Actress, Empress, Saint</i> he describes 
                how Theodora had chosen the legal genius Tribonian to serve as a key ally at court. Tribonian had been tasked by Justinian to sort out the complex and often obscure laws of the 
                Roman Empire, subsequently tabulated in the <i>Codex Justinius</i>. This is one of the foundational legal texts of western legal history and it stands with the Hagia Sofia as a powerfully 
                unique document of both Theodora’s and Justinian’s lasting legacy. Potter believes that Theodora’s influence runs directly through the code, especially when it comes to woman’s rights. 
            </span> <br></br>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
            <i>A law of 531 stating that the slave concubine of a man who had died could not be reduced to slavery by his heirs, but rather, unless her partner had specified her continued slavery in his will, 
            she and her children would be free, would appear to evince a concern to protect otherwise powerless women.</i>
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Historian Jonathan Harris puts it into perspective in relation to Greece, Rome and more modern times:
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab"><i>Yet curiously, Byzantine women did enjoy certain rights that their British and American counterparts did not receive until the nineteenth century. 
            They could make contracts and wills, even if married, and their dowries remained their own possession, separate from their husband’s property. If the husband predeceased the wife, she took 
            control of his property as well as her own and became the head of the household, the legal guardian of any underage children. That the theocratic empire should be more ‘modern’ in one respect 
            than democratic Greece or republican Rome should be taken as a warning against judging past societies by our own standards.</i>
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">It must surely have required the influence and unique intelligence of such a figure as Theodora to help implement this sort of change, and to in some 
            way focus attention on the downtrodden. This was revolutionary stuff. But it also took this type of political system to allow for somebody like Theodora to even get to a point where she could exert 
            such influence, this just would not have happened in democratic Ancient Greece, and did not happen. Justinian trusted her and Severus respected Theodora and her powerful intelligence. Again, 
            high status women in ancient Greece were certainly respected, but systematically denied any political agency. 
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">As Potter demonstrates, Theodora sought directly to help women who found themselves in unfortunate situations and were thus subjected to the 
            vagaries of repressive patriarchal systems. The historian again encapsulates this in Theodora’s remarkable creation of Metanoia:
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab"><i>The women for whom <regular>Metanoia</regular> was intended were not high-class concubines, but rather, victims, by and large, of the ancient equivalent of sex 
            trafficking: women from poor families who were brought to Constantinople and exploited by brothel owners. In what reads very much like a quotation from a law on the subject, Procopius explains 
            that the emperor and Theodora, who “shared a common piety” in all they did, expelled the brothel keepers from the city. Recognising that, in eliminating the brothels, they had deprived the
             prostitutes of the wherewithal to earn a living, Justinian and Theodora created <i>Metanoia</i>, a place where women could go to recover their trauma […] As with her earlier efforts to protect child 
             prostitutes, she treats prostitution, not as a moral issue, but as a social one, the result of economic deprivation, which she attempts to solve partly by giving pensions to Metanoia’s residents.</i>
            </span> <br></br>
            <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">A lot of this would have served to impress a spiritual benevolence and deliver a strong theological message to the public of good deeds and moral 
                sobriety. Inscribing and disseminating a strong public message would have been everything, and that is no more truer today than back then. Getting the balance right is crucial – too much radical 
                reform can awaken dark forces, whereas too little starves the imperial image of public oxygen. Justinian would have wanted Theodora to form much of this image. After all it is her bejewelled 
                countenance which stands out in prominence in the famous mosaic in Ravenna, not Justinian’s. But she gave him more, she became more and wanted more. She became a leader and strategist and 
                Justinian obviously trusted her judgement. Without her it is thought that he would have most likely lost the empire. She is said to have stood firm during the Nika Revolt when, he, most probably, 
                would have fled Constantinople.
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Ancient Greece on the other hand was a place where someone of Neaera’s status enjoyed very little legal protection (or otherwise). Although rare, at 
            certain moments human concern for her welfare shines through from her case narrative – but ultimately she was at the mercy of her legal status as both non-citizen and courtesan. 
        </span> <br></br>
        <span style="font-family: Antic Slab">Unfortunately the law in our contemporary world has still a remarkably long way to go – and the centuries following Theodora’s reign demonstrate
             little by way of progress, with an all powerful christian church emboldened to inimically determine a devastatingly narrow image of women within society. This effectively left the majority of women 
             in the grip of stultifying repression – even with the many vaunted figures who fought to rectify this, such as the medieval countess Christine de Pizan. Helena Kennedy QC has recently revealed in her 
             book <i>Eve was Shamed</i> that our legal system is still suffering from a crippling lack of reform. Insufficiently geared to help the downtrodden, Kennedy reveals a procedural platform rife with
              sexism such that it seems to be hewn into the structural edifice – a gordian knot of judicial imbalance. It has been oft claimed by political theorists that it is easier to identify political repression 
              in autocratic regimes, whereas in democracies (or perhaps capitalist democracies) – with a championing of core beliefs such as freedom of speech, checks and balances – it is paradoxically 
              much harder to identify. This truth is given stark credence when society has been up until recently thoroughly blind to systemic, institutionalised racism and interminable misogyny. These 
              problems seem to unfortunately extend to trusted institutions like The BBC – as demonstrated when the presenter Samira Ahmed won her tribunal case for unfair discrimination in unequal pay.
