        <h2 id="sub"><i>In ancient Greek the word for bow can also mean life (βῐ́ος) – the bow of a bow and arrow then, as Heraclitus has it, implies a 
            contradictory play – because its meaning is life and its work is death. But then the bow of the musical lyre is also a freedom 
            giving means of artistic expression.</i></h2>

        <i><span style="font-size: 100px">S</span>ign o’ the Times</i>, the 1987 album by Prince is regarded by many aficionados as his best. And, importantly, it marked a 
        decidedly dark and more experimental turn for an artist of an already unequalled and often gravity defying brilliance. 
        The celebrated title track <i>Sign o' the Times</i> brought to pop, indeed mainlined, the essence of Detroit techno (<i>pace</i> Kraftwerk) 
        with an experimental synth loop that at once orders its tempo and shape, while sonorously channelling the dark energy of the
         motor city’s newfound musical code. Right from the beginning this is aligned with declamatory lyrics mourning a war-torn 
         world and the destructive impulse of human nature. But even if this voice is an aching lyre for humanity’s woes the backbone 
         pulsing electronic loop effortlessly discounts it. At once particular and continuous, 
         it plaits a pointillist chain like a thread of troniced DNA – a propulsive, adamant technology laced with hypnotic, scientific allure. 
         When eviscerated by the artist’s explosive chorus it eerily returns undefeated and reminding, effecting an overall hollowed out
          existentialism.
        </span></p1><br></br>

        <p2 id="prince2"><span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
            In straightforward terms the song imparts an uncontroversial message on the futility of control and the arrogance of reason. 
            We can move within space, but we cannot control time. The worldly artist, Prince seems to say, has since time immemorial 
            attempted to control both – while instinctively knowing that art is the only means of achieving any freedom at all.
        </span></p2><br></br>
            <p3 id="prince3"><span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
                This was Prince’s first album release since the disbandment of his pop group ensemble, <i>The Revolution</i>, and two years after 
                Juan Atkins had exploded onto the underground club scene with an irreverent, celestial incarnation of Detroit soul. His label, 
                Metroplex, was urban and futuristic, giving birth to a new genre labelled techno. A term, it should be added, which derives 
                from the ancient Greek <i>tékhnē</i>, meaning craft, art, and giving birth to (incidentally, the word music derives from <i>mousikē</i> 
                <i>tékhnē</i>, art of the Muses – dance, <i>chorós</i>, was fundamental to Greek culture). Although Detroit techno artists would have been 
                undoubtedly influenced by Prince, Atkins and others were also crucially motivated by what arguably lend <i>Sign o' the 
                Times</i> its most distinctive characteristics: alienation, technology, and the cosmological out there. . .
            </span></p3><br></br>

            <p4 id="prince4"><span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
                Detroit techno sounded (and still does) as if it came from distant dark galaxies, pulsing back to us through broad canvased nebulae and 
                mythically named star clusters. The methods of production, and the singular technical mindset of the techno producer, 
                equipped these artists with the tools to seek out a certain anonymity and working autonomy (underground, with echos of 
                Ralph Ellison’s invisible man), meaning the bedroom became a conceptual space for artistic innovation. This then meant 
                that they could in principle control the means of production and, crucially, the time devoted to it. 
            </span></p4><br></br>
            <p5 id="prince5"><span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
                The critical importance of this development lies in the fact that these artists could effectively escape mainstream cultural 
                space and time. A culture which would have invariably stifled their creativity and ignored them because of their African 
                American identity. At sixteen, Carl Craig could spend endless hours working on experimentations he would later call 
                <i>Elements</i>. Much of it distilled through the hauntingly introspective masterpiece, <i>Neurotic Behaviour</i>, where technology 
                and music seem to confusedly merge. The resulting dissonant struggle for shape and form is like some strange new entity's 
                attempt to build psychological coherence or purchase amid churning resistance. This was the birth of a new sort of musical 
                theatre, and the piece arguably continued the work of experimental German outfit Popal Vuh in critiquing the decadent opulence of western music.
                
            
            </span></p5><br></br>
            <p6 id="prince6"><span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
                Of course this type of cultural decoupling wasn’t without its immediate forerunners with the obvious examples of early 
                hip-hop and house. And Kraftwerk, in a mentally scarred post-war Europe, broke with industry convention by creating 
                their own music studio and effectively presenting it as both an art-piece instrument and concept sculpture.
            </span></p6><br></p6>
            <p7 id="prince7"><span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
                But the intensified experimental nature of the new Detroit sound arguably allowed for a radically more explosive imaginative
                 unfolding. In this, Juan Atkins’ label Metroplex delivered masterful stuff – as <i>Game One</i> (Infinity EP), <i>Cosmic Courier</i>, <i>Pick
                  up the Flow</i>, and, of course, Robert Hood’s iconic <i>Detroit – One Circle</i>, all attest. The pacy, pared back and often lengthy 
                  four-four percussive compositions played on music’s commercial radio utility, or what was 
                  deemed permissible between adverts. This supposedly more direct, minimal tunnelling through time paradoxically
                   opened up the imagination to different, alternative cultural possibilities and realities. The resulting defiance had the
                    intended consequence of artistically and culturally protesting a more pointed break from society’s predominant liberal 
                    conservatism. A political economy that in the eighties had mutated into Reaganomic neoliberalism and intensified 
                    globalisation – accelerating the interminable decline of Michigan’s auto industries, and continuing the US’s ongoing 
                    failure regarding the African American community.
                </span></p7><br></br>
                <p8 id="prince8"><span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
                    Critical to enriching the cultural scope of this new artistic endeavour, is that Chicago house (as with disco) had importantly 
                    laid the foundations of a much needed counterculture rubric of alternative love. And by the 90s Metroplex’s EP, <i>Down</i>, by 
                    Aaron-Carl, carried forth the torch, with raw, elemental force. It immediately became an unlikely gay dance-floor classic with 
                    its punked techno attitude, lazy percussive pistons, and gravel-trapped vocals that croon heavy with fervid want.
                </span></p8><br></br>
                    <p9 id="prince9"><span style="font-family: Antic Slab">
                    But if the effect was again to provide an imaginative response for those who suffered extreme social alienation, their silenced 
                    and silent hurting was to be answered through a newly descriptive art. The key difference with Detroit techno is that it was 
                    sculpted through an aesthetic which bore in close to the reality of marginalised existence – closely transmuting or transfiguring
                     those same alienating forces that people were forced to deal with on a daily basis. The music thus mirrored back dark
                      industrial, experimentally probing sounds, but in improbably warm, soulful terms. Not to mention the fact that it was 
                      extraordinarily playful. In the instance of <i>Down</i>, the touchingly macho toughing-it-with-vulnerability sentiment is deferentially
                       cooled by Aaron-Carl, whose tender-felt lyrics shunt soft with an earnest plea: ‘even though we can’t have babies, we can 
                       still have fun’. Detroit techno was not bound by cold experimentation, far from it. It presented a cleverly subtle subversion of
                        American reality with a variety of innovations – ingeniously repurposing cultural materials and supposedly redundant 
                        technologies. The factory clock may tell of tyrannical production time, but Detroit artists could up the percussive ante and 
                        transcend the crippling limits of contemporary existence with greater creative, human purpose. Perhaps this is why artist 
                        Jeff Mills’ signature series of early releases comes under the name Purpose Maker. (Tony Cokes is a notably interesting 
                        contemporary artist whose themes consider dance music culture and identity politics within this realm).

                        This subterranean explorative edge shattered the anodyne regularity of mainstream cultural experience, and the synthetic drug 
                        of choice when listening to the often exhilarating club sets, xtc, likewise warped individual time experience. It elevated a 
                        dancer’s sensitivity to these astral-laved sounds, the kaleidoscopic colours of which were somehow graphed onto the
                         stems of shuttling, interchanging percussive pathways and counterpoint rhythms. On this drug, in this intensely felt 
                         environment, time moves very fast, almost imperceptible – the body becomes more fluidly warm, free and afloat in 
                         concert with an operatic, spacetime dance. With a track such as Kelli Hand’s <i>Come on Now Baby</i>, with its lassoing 
                         vocals and raucous drive, the effect of this would have been absolutely mesmeric...
